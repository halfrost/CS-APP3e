This directory contains the files that you will need to run the CS:APP
architecture lab, which develops a student's understanding of
processor design and the close relationship between software and
hardware.

************
1. Overview
************

In this lab, students learn about the design and implementation of a
pipelined Y86 processor, optimizing its performance on a benchmark Y86
array copy program called ncopy.ys. Students are allowed to make any
semantics preserving transformations to the benchmark program, or to
make enhancements to the pipelined processor, or both. The goal is to
minimize the number of clock cycles per array element (CPE).

3. Building the Lab
*******************

Step 1: Build the "master distribution" of the Y86 tools in directory
./src on your system. The master distribution is the instructor's
version of the tools that contains the solution files for the lab.
See ./src/README for instructions on how to build the master
distribution. The process involves setting three variables in
./src/Makefile and then typing "make". The default values are for
Linux.

Step 2. Modify ./src/Makefile-sim with the same three variable
assignments that you used in ./src/Makefile.  The Makefile-sim file is
the Makefile that the students will use their in their personal
student distributions of the Y86 tools. The student distribution is a
subset of the master distribution, minus the solution files and a
master set of HCL files.

Step 3. Modify ./src/Makefile-handout with the default team name
(TEAM), default handin version number (VERSION), and the directories
where the three parts should be copied to when they are handed in
(HANDINDIR-PART{A,B,C}). The Makefile-handout file is the 
the Makefile that the students receive in the archlab-handout/.
They use it to hand in their solutions.

Step 4: Modify the Latex writeup in ./writeup/archlab.tex to reflect
the handout and handin directions for your site. If you don't use
Latex, use your favorite document preparation system to prepare
Postcript and PDF versions of the writeup in archlab.ps and
archlab.pdf.

Step 5: Modify ./Makefile with the name of the lab (LABNAME) and the
name of the directory where the handout tarfile will be copied to and
where the students can pick it from (DEST). LABNAME is typically
archlab.

Step 6: In the same directory as this README file, type

	make clean; make

to the shell. This will do the following things:

(a) Compile the master distribution of the Y86 tools in ./src
(b) Build the student distribution in ./sim
(c) Build a tarfile of the student distribution	in sim.tar
(d) Build a handout directory ./$(LABNAME)-handout
(e) Build the $(LABNAME)-handout.tar file that you will be 
    handing out to students.

Step 7: Type "make dist" to copy the $(LABNAME)-handout.tar file
and the writeup to the distribution directory where the students
will retrieve the lab.

4. Grading the Lab
******************

There are Perl autograding scripts for each part of this lab. 
See ./grade/README for details.

*********
5. Notes
*********

* The lab compiles with no warnings and passes all regression tests on
* the following systems:

	Linux/2.2.20, Pentium III, gcc 2.95.3, Gnu make, Perl 5
	Solaris/5.8, Sparc Ultra 80, gcc 2.95.3, Sun make, Perl 5
	Linux/2.6.18, Intel x86_64, gcc 4.3.5, Perl 5.8.8

* If you are running in GUI mode on a system with X windows, make sure
* that your DISPLAY environment variable is set:

	unix> setenv DISPLAY mymachine.myschool.edu:0

* The autograders for parts B and C run the regression tests in ptest/
* as part of the evaluation of the student solutions. On older
* systems, these tests can take a long time, 5 minutes or so, with
* most of the time being spent by the htest.pl script. If this is too
* long, you can sacrifice completeness for speed by commenting out the
* call to htest.pl in ptest/Makefile.
